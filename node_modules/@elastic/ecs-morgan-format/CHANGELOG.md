# @elastic/ecs-morgan-format Changelog

## v1.1.0

- Update @elastic/ecs-helpers@1.1.0 to get more robust HTTP req and res
  formatting.

- Add `apmIntegration: false` option to all ecs-logging formatters to
  enable explicitly disabling Elastic APM integration.
  ([#62](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/pull/62))

- Fix "elasticApm.isStarted is not a function" crash on startup.
  ([#60](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/issues/60))

## v1.0.0

- Update to @elastic/ecs-helpers@1.0.0: ecs.version is now "1.6.0",
  http.request.method is no longer lower-cased, improvements to HTTP
  serialization.

- Set "service.name" and "event.dataset" log fields if Elastic APM is started.
  This helps to filter for different log streams in the same pod and the
  latter is required for log anomaly detection.
  ([#41](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/issues/41))

- Add support for [ECS tracing fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-tracing.html).
  If it is detected that [Elastic APM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elastic-apm-node)
  is in use and there is an active trace, then tracing fields will be added to
  log records. This enables linking between traces and log records in Kibana.
  ([#35](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/issues/35))

- Fix passing of a format *name*, e.g. `app.use(morgan(ecsFormat('tiny')))`.

## v0.3.0

- Serialize "log.level" as a top-level dotted field per
  https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging/pull/33.
  [#23](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/pull/23)

## v0.2.0

- Use the version number provided by ecs-helpers - [#13](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-nodejs/pull/13)

## v0.1.0
